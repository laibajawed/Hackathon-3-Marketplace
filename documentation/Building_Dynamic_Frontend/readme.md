# Dynamic Frontend Components for Your Marketplace

## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the frontend development for our marketplace application. The primary focus was on building dynamic, reusable components and ensuring a responsive user interface. The project also integrated dynamic routing and state management to display data fetched from an external API.

## Component Overview

### Key Components Developed:

#### ProductCard
- Displays product details (e.g., name, price, image).
- Reusable across pages like product listing and related products sections.
- Dynamically fetches data from Sanity CMS.  

#### CategoryFilter
- Allows users to filter products by categories dynamically.
- Integrated with state management for seamless interaction.
- Dynamically fetches categories from Sanity CMS.  

#### FeaturedProducts
- Highlights top or promotional products.
- Fetches data dynamically from Sanity CMS.

#### AddToCart & CartContent
- Manages cart functionality.
- Updates cart items dynamically with local state.  

## Additional Features

### Styling and Responsiveness
Tailwind CSS was used for styling, ensuring:
- Mobile-first design.
- Consistent and scalable CSS classes.

All components were tested for:
- Mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- Consistent user experience across screen sizes.

### Dynamic Routing
Implemented using Next.js dynamic routes:
- Example: `/product/[id]` displays individual product details.
- `/category/[slug]` filters products by specific categories.
- Placeholder data used during development to test routes before API integration.

### State Management
React State and Context API:
- `useState` for local component-level state.
- `useContext` for global state, such as user authentication and cart management.

Example:
```tsx
const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);
const { cart, addToCart } = useContext(CartContext);
```

## Additional Pages

### Empty Cart Page
- Displays a message when the cart is empty.
- Provides a button to navigate back to the shop.

### Success Page
- Confirms successful order placement.
- Displays order summary and estimated delivery details.

### Orders List Page
- Lists all past orders of the user.
- Fetches order history dynamically from Sanity CMS.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Data Fetching Issues
- **Problem:** Errors while fetching data from Sanity CMS.
- **Solution:** Verified API keys and dataset configurations. Used mock data as a temporary fallback.

### Responsive Design Adjustments
- **Problem:** Inconsistent layouts on smaller screens.
- **Solution:** Tweaked Tailwind CSS classes and tested using browser developer tools.

### Dynamic Routing Errors
- **Problem:** Routes failed for invalid IDs or slugs.
- **Solution:** Added error handling and fallback pages in Next.js.
