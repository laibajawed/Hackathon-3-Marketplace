## Implementation Steps  

### Step 1: Functional Testing  
- **Key Features Tested:**  
  - **Product Listings:** Ensured accurate display of products.  
  - **Filters & Search:** Verified correct filtering and search results based on user inputs.  
  - **Cart Operations:** Tested adding, updating, and removing items from the cart.  
  - **Dynamic Routing:** Confirmed proper loading of individual product detail pages.  

- **Tools Utilized:**  
  - **Postman:** Validated API responses for accuracy and efficiency.  
  - **React Testing Library:** Assessed component behavior in different scenarios.  
  - **Cypress:** Conducted comprehensive end-to-end testing.  

- **Execution Process:**  
  - Developed detailed test cases for each feature.  
  - Simulated user interactions, including navigation, form submissions, and button clicks.  
  - Compared actual outputs with expected results to ensure functionality.  

### Step 2: Error Handling  
- **Implemented Strategies:**  
  - Used `try-catch` blocks to manage API failures gracefully.  
  - Provided fallback UI elements, such as "No items found" messages, when data was unavailable.  

- **Example Implementation:**  
  ```javascript
  try {
    const data = await fetchProducts();
    setProducts(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching products:", error);
    setError("Unable to load products. Please try again later.");
  }
